Scenario 2

Coronavirus test and vaccine booking application. We chose to propose this idea as Coronavirus is a very relevant topic at the minute, and it looks like the virus will be with us for a while yet. As of yet, a Coronavirus booking system has not yet been developed in Ireland, which allows the patient to schedule their own appointment at a time that is convenient for them. At the minute, this is automatically done for the patient, to which they receive a text confirming a day and time slot allocated to them. This project proposal requires the creation and development of a booking system application for patients being tested for Covid-19. The application will ask the patient to enter their log-in details. The system can also be used to find out the results of your test.
